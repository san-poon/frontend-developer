# Web Forms - Working with user data

## What are web forms?

**Web forms** are one of the main points of interaction between a user and a web site or application. Forms allow users to enter data, which is generally set to a web server for processing and storage, or used on the client-side to immediately update the interface in some way.
A web form's HTML is made up of one or more **form controls** (sometimes called **widgets**), plus some additional elements to help structure the overall form -- they are often referred to as **HTML forms**.
