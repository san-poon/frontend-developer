# Internet

## How does the internet work?

The internet is the backbone of the Web, the technical infrastructure that makes the Web possible. At its most basic, the Internet is a large network of computers which communicates all together. Dive deeper [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/How_does_the_Internet_work).

Note: The Internet is an infrastructure, whereas the Web is a service build on top of the infrastructure. It is worth noting there are several other services built on top of the Internet, such as email and [IRC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IRC).

## What is HTTP?

HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol which allows the fetching of resources, such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser.
A complete document is reconstructed from the different sub-documents fetched, for instance text, layout description, images, videos, scripts, and more.

## Browsers and how they work?

A **web browser** is a software application for accessing information on the Web. When a user requests a web page from a particular website, the web browser retrieves the necessary content from a web server and then displays the page on the user's device.

## DNS and how it works?

DNS (Domain Name System) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for Internet connected resources. DNS maintains a list of domain names along with the resources, such as IP addresses, that are associated with them.

The most prominent function of DNS is the translation of human-friendly domain names (such as mozilla.org) to a numeric IP address (such as 151.106.5.172); this process of mapping a domain name to the appropriate IP address is known as a DNS lookup. By contrast, a reverse DNS lookup (rDNS) is used to determine the domain name associated with an IP address.

## What is domain name?

A **domain name** is an identification *string* that defines a realm of administrative autonony, authority or control within the *Internet*.
Domain names are used in various networking contexts and for application-specific naming and addressing purposes.
In general, a domain name identifies a *network domain*, or it represents an *Internet Protocol*(IP) resource, such as personal computer used to access the Internet, a server computer hosting a website, or the website iteself or any other service communicated via the Internet.

## What is hosting?
